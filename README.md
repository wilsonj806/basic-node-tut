# Basic Node Tutorial/ Project
Basic node tutorial/ project. Starting a server, maybe using Express.js as well

## Purpose

This project is pretty much a baby's first Node project/ App. The objective is to have a basic project up and running using Node.js and if applicable, Express.js. In addition, ample documentation and notes will be provided to explain what's going on.

**Extra Bonus**: Port the project over to TypeScript later.
